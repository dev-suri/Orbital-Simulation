Simulating Orbit of Apollo Around the Moon to Determine angle and speed at which craft is pulled back towards Earth (Free Return)

Here is the image of the orbit produced by this code:

At a speed of 1527 m/s, and angle of 24.0 degrees with respect to Earth, the forces of the Earth and Moon combined will pull a craft of similar weight to Apollo 11 back towards Earth, after looping once around the moon.
